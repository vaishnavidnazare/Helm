# Components of helm chart

Repo - consists of different charts stored in this central repository

Chart - Bundled application or manifests.

release - deployed instance of the chart (just a unique name we give to chart while installing, so that if we require same chart for another use later we can give it another name).



# Intstallation

`helm install <release_name> <chart_name>`

# To update the repo after adding is a best practice

`helm repo update <repo_name>`

# To unistall a chart we need to use the release name we have set
`helm uninstall <release_name>`
