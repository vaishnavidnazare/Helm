# What is Helm??

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes which allows you to install Kubernetes controllers.
It also allows you to update, uninstall and package application into charts for use.

# Why Helm?

Makes managing packages easier without need to writing scripts to install number of packages.

# Install Helm

Using helm documentation, install helm.
For v3 of k8s onwards we do not require to install anything on k8s cluster.

Helm connects to the correct cluster using the context set.


# Working

We need to first add a repository of the package we want to install and then install the package.

`helm repo add <repo_url>`    for e.g: Bitnami repository has most of the popular charts. 

`helm install <chart_name>`

Helm repo includes chart which is basically the package of your application.

To search for the charts in a repository(bitnami) we can do ,
`helm search repo bitnami | grep elastic`
